              <p>
                Founded by a group of passionate educators and parents, our school started as a small 
                classroom with just 15 students. Our founders were united by a common belief in the 
                potential of every child and the importance of providing an environment where children 
                could develop naturally according to their individual needs and capabilities.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Growth</h2>
              <p>
                Over the years, we've grown from that single classroom to our current campus, 
                expanding our programs while maintaining our commitment to excellence in education. 
                Each step of our growth has been guided by our founding principles and the needs 
                of our community.

                Today, we serve hundreds of students across multiple age groups, providing a 
                nurturing environment where children develop independence, critical thinking skills, 
                and a genuine love for learning. Our dedicated staff continues to uphold the vision 
                of our founders while embracing innovative approaches to education.
